Code Explanation
go

package main
This defines the package as main.

In Go, the main package is special because it tells the Go compiler that this is an executable program (not a library).

go
Copy
Edit
import "fmt"
This imports the fmt (format) package, which provides functions for formatted I/O (like printing to the console).

go
Copy
Edit
func main() {
This defines the main function.

Every Go program must have a main function inside the main package.

Execution starts from main().

go

    fmt.Println("Go project is set up!")
fmt.Println(...) is used to print text to the console.

It prints "Go project is set up!" followed by a new line
